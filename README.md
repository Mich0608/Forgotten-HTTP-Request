# Forgotten-HTTP-Request

In her book _Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art_, Virginia Heffernan writes,
"The Internet is paradigmatic magic. It turns experiences from the material world that used to be densely physical--involving licking stamps, say, or widing clocks or driving in cars to shopping centers--into frictionless, weightless, and fantastic abstractions."

My piece "Forgotten HTTP Request" is in response to Heffernan's idea of magic and loss in the internet age. Everyday, billions of HTTP request packets travel through the Internet to retrieve the webpages that create the magic of the Internet. Although these requests are only bytes of data, we describe them with the language that we use to describe physical postage--"packets," "retrieve," "requests," etc. My piece materializes this abstraction by representing an HTTP request as a physical letter, sent from one corner of the world to another and bearing a specific addresss. However, with the advent of digital communication, physical letters are becomming less and less common. My piece also speaks to this sense of loss and nostalgia when we look back on the pre-Internet age. "Forgotten HTTP Request" is a play on the trope of a letter forgotten at the cornner of a drawer. I chose to represent this sense of loss with snowfall.
